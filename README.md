# Julia Bug: Unexpected behavior with complex numbers in conditional statements

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in Julia when dealing with complex numbers within conditional statements. The issue arises when a function containing `if`, `elseif`, and `else` statements is provided with complex numbers as input.  The results deviate from what one might intuitively expect based on the function's logic for real numbers.

The `bug.jl` file contains the code exhibiting the issue. The `bugSolution.jl` file shows one possible solution.
